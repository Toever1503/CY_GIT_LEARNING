Every thousand years, all the gods of the world gather in heaven to attend the Conference of Mankind Survival. The gods agree to end to mankind due to their foolish acts, but before the final verdict is made, Brunhild, the eldest of the 13 valkyrie sisters, makes an objection.

“To spice things up, why don’t you test the humans?”

She proposes that the all-powerful gods face off in one-on-one battles against the strongest champions from human history — during a final struggle known as “Ragnarok.” The first team to win 7 out of 13 battles will be declared the winner, but it seems almost impossible for humans to win against the gods.

“Are you chickening out?”

Her words hit the gods’ nerves, and, enraged, they accept her proposal. Now, Brunhild and her sisters must choose humanity’s 13 champions in a desperate battle for survival.

The story of <i>SHAREDOL</i> is set in the Edo period, the Kansei era (1789-1800), a time when entertainment was strictly restricted.

The protagonist produces six girls - a teahouse girl, a samurai girl, a Dutch trading house girl, a merchant girl, an oiran (high-ranking courtesan), and a kunoichi (female ninja), who have lived a different life. <br><br>

<br>
Jashin-chan is a demon who was summoned by Yurine Hanazono, a gothic looking girl. Unable to return home as the relevant spell was not included in the summoning grimoire, Jashin-chan resorts to violence to liberate herself from her earthly shackles.<br>
<br>
However, this is easier said than done, as Yurine is no weakling herself. She in fact possesses formidable physical power and uses it to massacre Jashin-chan in a variety of ways, be it shoving her arm in a blender, spreading her intestines across the room or even cooking her. Though these actions would be fatal to anyone without the ability to regenerate, Jashin-chan isn't exactly undeserving of this treatment. Stuck with each other, Yurine lets Jashin-chan live with her in exchange for work around the apartment, and this cohabitation results in situations where, more often than not, Jashin-chan ends up in pieces.<br>
